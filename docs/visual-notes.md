# Visual Direction Notes

### 2. The "Fluid Distortion" (Liquid Look)
What it is: Content that warps and ripples like water when you move the mouse.
Drop-in: Use a post-processing wrapper with a custom shader pass.
Keywords: RGB shift, chromatic aberration, fluid simulation fragment shader, liquid distortion.

### 4. Cinematic Post-Processing
What it is: Adding grain, bloom, and vignettes to make it look like a movie rather than a website.
Notes: Keep the effect subtle for legibility; scale down on mobile for performance.
