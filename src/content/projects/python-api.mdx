## Problem
Design a reliable backend system with clean API design and optimized data access.

## Approach
Built a multi-tier FastAPI service with SQLAlchemy models, schema validation, and RESTful routing. Added indexing and
ORM-level caching to improve query performance and wired GitHub Actions for CI/CD with pytest automation.

## Results
- 15% faster data retrieval via optimized queries
- Modular, testable API design
