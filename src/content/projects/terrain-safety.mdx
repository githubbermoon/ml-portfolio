## Problem
Assess traversability and visualize safe navigation paths for autonomous terrain traversal.

## Approach
Used SegFormer for 150-class semantic segmentation and Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth. Built a safety-score
algorithm with A* pathfinding to render optimal routes on a 3D terrain mesh. Added slope + morphology refinements to
reduce false positives and wired W&B for experiment tracking.

## Results
- 3D terrain mesh routing visualization
- Robust hazard detection with geometric refinement
